Page Layout Designs
 four general categories: fixed, fluid, elastic, and responsive
 
 fixed 
 page size and page elements are fixed
 best used in circumstances when we know the exact device that would be used to view the web page
 
 Fluid 
 dynamic effect where the page resizes automatically to fit the screen resolution of the userâ€™s device
 
 Elastic 
 layout is where all CSS measurements are expressed in em units and 
 based on the default font size that is used in the page
 
 Responsive 
 preferred option for page layout
 page automatically accommodates to the user screen size
 web developer would need to create separate styles for mobile devices, tablet devices, and desktop computers
 
 Working with Width and Height
  Often, the height of an element is not set, 
  since browsers automatically increase the height of an element to match its content
  
  Floating Page Content
  float attribute can be used to move an element from its normal position and 
  place it along the left or right edge of its parent element
   By default, an element has no float
   float can be cleared by setting the clear property to none (the default), left, right, or both left and right.
   To keep float elements within the same row, the correct box-sizing property must be used
   The default is content-box for the type, while the other is border-box
    border-box type is preferred by most designers to avoid any confusion about the total width of each element
    Failing to specify the box-sizing property might result in having web page elements collapse
    
    
    img {
  float: right;
}
<img src="pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">


Horizontal & Vertical Align
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp
To horizontally center a block element (like <div>), use margin: auto;
Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.
.center {
  margin: auto;
  width: 50%;
  border: 3px solid green;
  padding: 10px;
}


The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins
